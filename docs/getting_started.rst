To use conctools in a Python project, import it like this::

    import conctools

From there, you can use the functionality of the package. You could for example
create a reinforced concrete cross section by::

    conctools.Section(<inputs>)


Alternatively, you could::

    from conctools import Section

and create a cross section by::

    Section(<inputs>)
